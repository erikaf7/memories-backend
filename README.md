## Description
This is the back-end side of the memories application. Memories is a scrapbooking application where you create the story. Add scrap book entries and share your memories with others. To view the repository for the front-end side of the memories application, go to https://github.com/erikaf7/memories-frontend.

## Getting Started
This back-end API is hosted on https://app-memories-backend.herokuapp.com/. To view the front-end, user accessible application, go to https://app-memories-frontend.herokuapp.com/.


## Technologies Used
- Javascript
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- Express
- Node

## Approach Taken
We created this database to store the data of the user entries and user accounts to be accessed by the front-end side of our application. We used user authorization to make sure that posts could only be edited or deleted by the user who created them.
